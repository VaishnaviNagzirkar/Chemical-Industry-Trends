<h1>Global Nickel Sulphate Market Research Report 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>nickel sulphate market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 3.14 billion in 2024 to USD 5.27 billion by 2032</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.7%</strong> during the forecast period (2025-2032), according to a comprehensive market analysis. This expansion is primarily driven by soaring demand from electric vehicle battery manufacturers and the broader electroplating industry.</p><p><strong>1. EV Battery Revolution Accelerates Demand:</strong><br>
With global electric vehicle sales surpassing <strong>10 million units in 2022</strong> and projected to grow at <strong>25% CAGR</strong> through 2030, nickel sulphate has become a mission-critical material for lithium-ion battery cathodes. The transition toward high-nickel cathode chemistries (NMC 811 and NCA) is particularly significant, as these formulations require <strong>80-90% nickel content</strong> to enhance energy density and extend driving range.</p><p><strong>2. Electroplating Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
The <strong>USD 15 billion global electroplating market</strong> continues to drive substantial demand for nickel sulphate, particularly in automotive and electronics applications. Nickel-plated components are essential for corrosion resistance in everything from engine parts to semiconductor packaging, with the automotive sector alone accounting for approximately <strong>35% of plating-grade consumption</strong>.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
