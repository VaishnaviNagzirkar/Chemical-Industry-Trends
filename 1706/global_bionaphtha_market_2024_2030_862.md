<h1>Global Bionaphtha (Bio-based Naphtha) Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>Bionaphtha (Bio-based Naphtha) market</strong> is projected to exhibit substantial growth between 2024 and 2030, driven by increasing demand for sustainable fuel alternatives and green chemical feedstocks. According to the latest market intelligence, bionaphtha has emerged as a critical transitional solution for industries transitioning toward circular economy models while meeting stringent carbon emission regulations.</p><p><strong>1. Policy-Driven Demand for Low-Carbon Fuels:</strong><br>
Stringent regulations like the EU's Renewable Energy Directive RED II, mandating 14% renewable energy in transport by 2030, are accelerating adoption. Bio-naphtha's carbon reduction potential of <strong>75-90% compared to fossil naphtha</strong> makes it a preferred drop-in solution.</p><p><strong>2. Expanding Applications in Green Polymers:</strong><br>
The lightweight nature (26-30 API gravity) and hydrocarbon profile similar to fossil naphtha enable seamless integration into existing steam crackers. Major chemical companies are securing long-term supply agreements, with <strong>bio-PET and bio-PVC production growing at 18% CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
