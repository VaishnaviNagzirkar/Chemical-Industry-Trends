<h1>Global 2,3 Butanedione Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>2,3 Butanedione market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 145.7 million in 2024 to USD 198.3 million by 2030</strong>, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR of 5.2% during 2024-2030</strong>, according to the latest market research. This growth trajectory reflects the compound's expanding applications across food flavoring, fragrance production, and pharmaceutical intermediates, particularly in emerging markets.</p><p>2,3-Butanedione (commonly known as diacetyl) is an organic compound with a distinctive buttery aroma. While its use in food flavorings has faced regulatory scrutiny, purified high-grade 2,3-Butanedione remains indispensable for <strong>dairy flavor replication, processed food manufacturing, and specialty chemicals</strong>. Recent technological advancements in production methods have significantly improved purity levels, making it increasingly viable for pharmaceutical applications.</p><p><strong>1. Processed Food Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
The <strong>global processed food market</strong>, valued at USD 4.1 trillion in 2023, continues to drive demand for authentic flavor compounds. High-purity 2,3-Butanedione (&gt;99%) is experiencing <strong>12.4% annual growth</strong> in food applications, particularly in butter-flavored snacks, ready meals, and convenience foods. The compound's ability to replicate dairy flavors at low concentrations makes it cost-effective for large-scale food production.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
