<h1>Spark-Resistant Flooring Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>spark-resistant flooring market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>US$ 480 million in 2024 to US$ 680 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.9% during 2024â2030</strong>, according to a comprehensive market analysis. This growth is driven by increasing safety regulations in industrial facilities and rising demand for explosion-proof infrastructure across high-risk sectors.</p><p>Spark-resistant flooringâengineered to prevent static electricity buildup and minimize ignition risksâhas become essential in <strong>oil &amp; gas, chemical processing, and manufacturing plants</strong> where combustible dust or flammable vapors are present. These specialized floors combine <strong>conductive materials, anti-static properties, and durable surfaces</strong> to meet stringent workplace safety standards.</p><p><strong>1. Stricter Industrial Safety Mandates:</strong><br>
With workplace safety regulations becoming 30% more stringent since 2020 across North America and Europe, industries are prioritizing spark-resistant solutions. The <strong>OSHA 29 CFR 1910 and ATEX directives</strong> now mandate explosion-proof flooring in 78% of high-risk facilities, creating sustained demand.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
